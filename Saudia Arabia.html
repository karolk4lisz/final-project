<h2 class="centered-heading">Traditional Recipe for Jareesh </h2>
​<br>
<div class="container">
<div class="ingredients">
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<p>1 cup jareesh (crushed wheat)
<p>500g lamb or chicken, cut into small <br> pieces</p>
<p>1 large onion, finely chopped</p>
<p>3 cloves of garlic, minced</p>
<p>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</p>
<p>2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter)</p>
<p>1 teaspoon ground cumin</p>
<p>1 teaspoon ground coriander</p>
<p>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</p>
<p>Salt to taste</p>
<p>Water for cooking</p>
<p>Optional toppings:<br> fried onions, 
    chopped fresh parsley <br> or cilantro</p>
</div>
<div class="method">
<h4>Method</h4>
<p>1. Rinse the jareesh thoroughly under cold water and soak it in water for at least 1 hour. Drain and set aside. </p>
<p>2. In a large pot, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and sauté until golden brown and fragrant.</p>
<p>3. Add the meat pieces to the pot and cook until they are browned on all sides. This helps to develop the flavors.</p>
<p>4. Sprinkle the ground cumin, coriander, black pepper, and salt over the meat. Stir well to coat the meat evenly with the spices.</p>
<p>5. Pour enough water into the pot to cover the meat completely. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for about 1 hour or until the meat becomes tender.</p>
<p>6. Once the meat is tender, add the soaked jareesh to the pot. Stir well to combine the jareesh with the meat and spices.</p>
<p>7. Continue cooking the jareesh on low heat, stirring occasionally, for about 1-2 hours or until the jareesh grains are soft and well-cooked. Add more water if needed to maintain a thick, porridge-like consistency.</p>
<p>8. In a separate small pan, melt the ghee over medium heat. Add the ghee to the jareesh and stir it in to enhance the flavor.</p>
<p>9. Continue cooking the jareesh for another 10-15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper according to your taste.</p>
<p>10. Serve the jareesh hot in individual bowls. You can garnish each serving with fried onions and chopped fresh parsley or cilantro for added flavor and presentation.</p>
